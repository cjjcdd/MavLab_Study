# Hydrodynamic coefficients for the Delft Catamaran 372 (DC372)
#
# The coefficients listed here follow the Abkowitz notation for a
# slender ship performing manoeuvres in the horizontal plane.  They
# are provided in non‑dimensional form and are converted to
# dimensional values at run time in the `_dimensionalize_coefficients`
# method of the `Vessel` class.  See the lecture notes and the
# reference paper for further details on the scaling used.  The values
# used below are representative of the DC372 at a Froude number
# around 0.4 and may be adjusted by the user as required.
